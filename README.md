# Adaptive CVgen
This repository contains data processing scripts for Adaptive CVgen, an enhanced sampling method for studying complex molecular processes. The method was introduced in our publication:

ðŸ“„ Original Paper: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2414205121

# About This Repository
Currently, this repository provides scripts for trajectory processing and visualization, including TICA-based dimensionality reduction and phase-space analysis. 

# Full Source Code Availability
The full implementation of Adaptive CVgen is still being organized and will be released soon. Stay tuned for updates!
